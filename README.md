## Clothing Classification ðŸ‘•

### About


Project for Clothing classification, attempting to predict type of clothing from dataset. The main method used to accomplish this is image classification, employing custom made methods and methods from scikit-learn.

### Dependencies


*To run classify (mentioned version or newer):*

* Python 3

* any Jupyter Notebook interface

* NumPy 1.21.5

* pandas 1.3.5

* Matplotlib 3.5.1

* scikit-learn 1.2.2


### Guide

To be able to run our code and reproduce the results, there are a few things to consider:

* the initial data is inside the 'data' folder, which is important to note, when reproducing the results
* our custom made lda.py & bayes.py are in the repository, and are both already loaded into main.ipynb
* the main.ipynb contains all the code needed to be run, EXCEPT for the CNN classification ...
* ... which is all inside the CNN.ipynb & can be run explicitly from that notebook.
